# VehicleLicense
Modified and fixed version of [VehicleLicense on uMod](https://umod.org/plugins/vehicle-license)

~~The version that is closest to one on uMod is the one [without instant take-of](https://github.com/ViolationHandler-exe/VehicleLicense/blob/main/VehicleLicenceNoInstantMini.cs). The [instant take-off is just for minicopters](https://github.com/ViolationHandler-exe/VehicleLicense/blob/main/VehicleLicence.cs).~~

# Ignore above message ^^^^^
The plugin now has a config setting to **disable instant mini take-off** and the other version of VehicleLicense is **no longer required** to not have instant mini takeoff. Its **disabled by default** so the minis will take off like normal.
