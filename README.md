# VehicleLicense
Modified and fixed version of VehicleLicense on uMod

The version that is closest to one on uMod is the one [without instant take-of](https://github.com/ViolationHandler-exe/VehicleLicense/blob/main/VehicleLicenceNoInstantMini.cs). The (instant take-off is just for minicopters)[https://github.com/ViolationHandler-exe/VehicleLicense/blob/main/VehicleLicence.cs].
